## Description

This command-line application features various options to view information and add data given a database with some sample data for three tables (a department table, a role table, and an employee table). Please note the use of MySQL - see Links and Usage below. Also, the application provides an update option for the role-title of an employee as well as a view option that can display a selected department's budget amount (the total of the salary amounts). 

Please see Links and Usage for the link to a walkthrough video. The link to the repository is also included in that section. The use of the following can be observed from there: Node.js, the Inquirer package, the MySQL2 package, the console.table package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table), and the framework provided by edX Boot Camps LLC.
